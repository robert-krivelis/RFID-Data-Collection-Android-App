# RFID Data Collection Android App
This project started as a hackathon with innovation 4 health (I4H). Over the course of 8 weeks, interdisciplinary teams were formed to work together to try to solve the problems of sponsors working with.

## The Problem
Our sponsor was a labratory researcher who had a difficult problem. He wanted to measure his subject's hormones throughout the day using saliva samples, but was having difficulty ensuring that the samples were taken at the right time. Given his subjects were primarily teenagers and children with hectic schedules, they would often falsify the time tests were taken, forget to make measurements entirely, or perform them incorrectly. Our mission was to try to build a solution that would record accurate time data for when the measurements were taken.

## Initial Solutions

Our initial solution consisted of a test tube holder enclosure with a touch screen interface powered by raspberry pi zero. The test tubes held vials for testing saliva samples. These vials had RFID identification labels that were read by an RFID reader. A subject in the study would scan the vial while performing a test, as shown by instructions on the screen. Scanning the vial would record the time the test was performed. This data collection could be used by the research lab for a higher confidence dataset regarding the subjects and their measurements.
